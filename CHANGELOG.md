### Added: "Console" card in Javascript cheatsheet.

The added "Console" card provides a quick reference for JavaScript's console object, essential for debugging and logging. It includes:

- **Basic Methods**: Covers `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn`, and `console.error` for standard output, informational messages, warnings, and errors.
- **Debugging**: Highlights `console.table` for tabular data, `console.dir` for object properties, `console.time`/`timeEnd` for performance timing, and `console.trace` for stack traces.
- **Formatting (Highlight)**: Shows advanced formatting with `console.log` using CSS styling (`%c`), and `console.group`/`groupEnd` for organizing output.

The card uses a 🖥️ icon and is placed before "Async Programming" for logical flow, maintaining the cheatsheet's structure with code blocks and comments for clarity.
